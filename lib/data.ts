    description: 'Zero-knowledge password manager with AES-256 encryption. Backend API built with Node.js/Express, frontend with Next.js, deployed via Docker on Railway.',
    longDescription: 'Developed a robust password management solution implementing industry-standard security practices. The application uses AES-256 encryption for credential storage, ensuring maximum security for sensitive user data. Built with a secure JWT-based authentication system that provides stateless session management and enhanced API security. Master passwords are protected using bcrypt hashing with salt rounds, making them virtually impossible to reverse-engineer. The system follows a zero-knowledge architecture, ensuring complete user data privacy where even the server cannot access unencrypted credentials. Backend features a RESTful API design with Express for clean, maintainable endpoints, and PostgreSQL for reliable data persistence with ACID compliance. The entire application is containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments, and hosted on Railway platform for production-ready scalability and monitoring.',
